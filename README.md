# 🛠 Getting Started

To enable iCanText after installing:

2. Go to **General > Keyboard > Keyboards**.
3. Tap **"Add New Keyboard…"**
4. Select **iCanText** from the list.
5. (Optional) Tap **iCanText > Allow Full Access** to enable all features.

## Important

* Unusual: There is no spacebar. There is no backspace key.
* Swipe right for a space. Swipe left for backspace.
* Yes, the top row sways (the top row on a qwerty keyboard has one more key than the others).
* Swipe up for numbers. Swipe down for symbols.
* Two finger swipe down to toggle UPPER/lower case. 
* Use the 🔧 (fix it) key to fix up your text. 
    * iOS 26 users: Very robust fixing is done using Apple's on-device LLM.
    * pre-iOS 26 users: less robust fixing using some in-app based logic.

**Important:** iCanText **does not** collect or track your keystrokes or personal data.


## Quick tour

To take a quick tour, run the app from the main screen on your phone.  
* Tap into the text-box and bring up the usual iOS keyboard. 
* Then tap on the globe 🌐 in the lower left corner to bring up the iCanText keyboard.  
* Try typing with _it_ now.  Swipe up for numbers and down for punctuation. Can you text better?

## How iCanText can help you text

After selecting the iCanText keyboard using the globe 🌐 in the lower left of your normal keyboard, iCanText can help you text in this way:

 - The keys are **larger**
 - From the main QWERTY keyboard, swipe down for symbols and up for numbers
 - On the symbols keyboard, note the shortcuts on the bottom row. They'll handle texting those painful contractions on the English language, `'ll`, `'s`, `'r`, `'t`, `'m`, and `'ve` for you
 - Swipe right for a space and swipe right again for a period + space to end a sentence
 - Swipe left for a backspace
 - Double swipe down to toggle UPPER/lower case 


## 📖 The story behind iCanText

I am a Gen-X tech-savvy computer, phone, and device user. That said, I cannot text.  I just can't do it. Texting is a necessary part of our lives, and is nothing but an <i>exercise in frustration</i> for me.

I cannot text with my two thumbs. I cannot text with one thumb.  I cannot hold a phone with _both_ hands in a way that keeps my thumbs free.  I cannot send out a "quick" text; texting is very laborious and frustrating for me.   Sometimes I look at people who do that fast texting with their thumbs and marvel at their dexterity.  I simply cannot do this.

I have no choice but to text using my right index finger, while holding the phone in my left hand. Overall, this works horribly, but it's all I can seem to do. 

Sometimes while texting, it takes me 3-4 tries to get **one word** typed properly. I recall once when in a car, I was asked by the driver to send a text to some friends we were on our way to meet. Between my lack of texting skills and the vibration of the car, I got so frustrated that I gave up and tossed my phone into the back seat.

The word suggestions built in to the iOS keyboard rarely help and I feel pressured by them. Sometimes it will auto-correct a word into 3 smaller nonsensical words, that I then have to delete (and start over).  

The suggestion mechanism usually misses when I need an apostrophe after something like `we` to get a `we'll` vs `well`. Again, I need to delete this all to continue and it takes me forever to put in the contraction myself.  This is very frustrating.   I can't seem to get used to using the suggested words anyway, as I'm so focused on what I am reaching out to with my index finger. I almost never look at the word suggestion bar. 

I've tried gboard and tracing words on their keyboard. It's a cool idea, but didn't help me at all.  And for some reason, I don't like talking to my device (as in Siri, speech to text, etc.).

Indeed for me, texting simiple remains a frustrating and laborious, but as I said, it's a necessary and required part of life, so I have to do something about it.

### Enter: iCanText

Thus `iCanText` was born.  It has larger keys to make a larger target for my index finger.  It uses gestures to help me along and has separate gesture-triggered keyboards for symbols and numbers.  Instead of predicting words, it predicts the _next letter_, which seems more useful for the letter-by-letter nature of texting. It has special contraction keys for `'s` and `'re`, etc.

With iCanText, you can finally say to yourself "I can text!"


## 📝 Update

I've (the developer) been using iCanText for about 3 months now, and have quickly become use to it (I don't see myself going back to the stock iOS keyboard). 

iCanText is helping a lot with the texting difficulties I mentioned.  I find the right and left swipe gestures for space and backspace to be very natural for those actions. I really don't need the spacebar or backspace keys.

For iOS 26 users, having the on-device LLM correct texts before sending is <b>awesome</b>. (See the 🔧 key.) It produces beautifully worded and formatted text pretty much every time!  Something like:

`k. where are u? meet me at teh [sic] car a 10:30.` 

becomes 

`Okay.  Where are you? Meet me at the car at 10:30.` 

Wow. This is so helpful to me.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: The keyboard isn't showing up. What do I do?**  
A: Make sure it's enabled under Settings > General > Keyboard > Keyboards. You may need to restart the app you're typing in.

**Q: Why are the keys so large / swaying?**  
A: iCanText is designed for easier typing — especially helpful for users who prefer clarity, motion, or better tap targets. 

The top row of a QWERTY keyboard is a bit longer than the other rows, so it needs to sway to fit with the larger keys.

**Q: Does iCanText support emoji?**  
A: You can still access the system emoji keyboard by holding the globe 🌐 icon and selecting it.
