## 📖 The story behind iCanText

I am a Gen X tech-savvy computer/phone/device user. That said, I cannot text.  I just can't do it.

I cannot text with my two thumbs. I cannot text with one thumb.  I cannot hold a phone with _both_ hands in a way that keeps my thumbs free.  I cannot send out a "quick" text; texting is very laborious for me.   Sometimes I look at people who do that fast texting with their thumbs and marvel at their dexterity.  I simply cannot do this.

I have no choice but to text using my right index finger, while holding the phone in my left hand. Overall, this works horribly for me, but it's all I can seem to to do. 

Sometimes while texting, it takes me 3-4 tries to get **one word** typed properly. I recall once when in a car, I was asked by the driver to send a text to some friends we were on our way to meet. Between my lack of texting skills and the vibration of the car, I got so frustrated that I gave up and tossed my phone into the back seat.

The word suggestions built in to the keyboard rarely help me and I feel pressured by them. Sometimes it will "correct" a word into 3 smaller nonsensical words, that I then have to delete.  The suggestion mechanism also usually misses when I need an apostrophe after something like `we` to get a `we'll` vs `well`. Again, I need to delete this all to continue and it takes me forever to put in the contraction myself.  This is very frustrating.   I can't seem to get used to using the suggested words anyway, as I'm so focused on what I am reaching out to with my index finger. I almost never look at the word suggestion bar. I've tried gboard and tracing words on their keyboard. It's a cool idea, but didn't help me at all.  And for some reason, I don't like talking to my device (as in Siri, speed to text, etc.).

Indeed for me, texting simiple remains a frustrating and laborious, but necessary and required part of life.

Thus `iCanText` was born.  It has larger keys to make a larger target for my index finger.  It uses gestures to help me along and has separate gesture-triggered keyboards for symbols and numbers.  Instead of predicting words, it predicts the _next letter_, which seems more useful for the letter-by-letter nature of texting.


## 🛠 Getting Started

To enable iCanText after installing:

1. Open **Settings** on your iPhone.
2. Go to **General > Keyboard > Keyboards**.
3. Tap **"Add New Keyboard…"**
4. Select **iCanText** from the list.
5. (Optional) Tap **iCanText > Allow Full Access** to enable all features.

> 💡 Full access is optional. iCanText does **not** collect or track your keystrokes or personal data.

To take a quick tour, run the app from the main screen on your phone.  Tap into the text-box and bring up the (usual)keyboard. Then tap on the globe 🌐 in the lower left corner to bring up the iCanText keyboard.  Try typing with _it_ now.  Swipe up for numbers and down for punctuation. Can you text better?

## How iCanText can help you text

After selecting the iCanText keyboard using the globe 🌐 in the lower left of your normal keyboard, iCanText can help you text in this way:

 - The keys are **larger**
 - From the main QWERTY keyboard, swipe down for symbols and up for numbers
 - On the symbols keyboard, note the shortcuts on the bottom row. They'll handle texting those painful contractions on the English language, `'ll`, `'s`, `'r`, `'t`, `'m`, and `'ve` for you
 - Swipe right for a space and swipe right again for a period + space to end a sentence
 - Swipe left for a backspace
 - Double swipe down to toggle UPPER/lower case 

 With iCanText, you can finally say to yourself "I can text!"

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: The keyboard isn't showing up. What do I do?**  
A: Make sure it's enabled under Settings > General > Keyboard > Keyboards. You may need to restart the app you're typing in.

**Q: Why are the keys so large / swaying?**  
A: iCanText is designed for easier typing — especially helpful for users who prefer clarity, motion, or better tap targets. 

The top row of a QWERTY keyboard is a bit longer than the other rows, so it needs to sway to fit with the larger keys.

**Q: Does iCanText support emoji?**  
A: You can still access the system emoji keyboard by holding the globe 🌐 icon and selecting it.
