# iCanText – Support Page

Welcome to the official support page for **iCanText**, the smart, swaying keyboard with large, easy-to-tap keys.

## 📖 The story behind iCanText

I am a Gen X tech-savvy computer/phone/device user. I have no problems with the use and purpose of all of our devices. I own practically all of Apple's devices and use them daily.  Sometimes I laugh at how I have four Apple devices on me at any given time. That said, I cannot text.  I just can't do it.

I cannot text with my two thumbs. I cannot text with one thumb.  I can't even seem to hold a phone with _both_ hands.  So, I mostly use my right index finger, while holding the phone in my left hand. This works generally horribly. 

Sometimes it takes me 3-4 tries to form **one single word** properly. Auto-correct rarely helps. Sometimes it auto-corrects a word into 3 smaller nonsensical words with spaces in between!  I usually have to manually put in a `'` after `we` to get a `we'll` vs `well`. This takes me forever.   gboard and tracing words on a keyboard didn't help.  Also, I simply cannot get used to using suggested words.  Texting is a very frustrating but necessary and required task.

Thus `iCanText` was born.  It has larger keys to make a larger target for my index finger.  It uses gestures more and has separate gesture-triggered keyboards for symbols and numbers.  Instead of predicting words, it predicts the _next letter_, which seems more useful for the letter-by-letter nature of texting.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: The keyboard isn't showing up. What do I do?**  
A: Make sure it's enabled under Settings > General > Keyboard > Keyboards. You may need to restart the app you're typing in.

**Q: Why are the keys so large / swaying?**  
A: iCanText is designed for easier typing — especially helpful for users who prefer clarity, motion, or better tap targets. 

The top row of a QWERTY keyboard is a bit longer than the other rows, so it needs to sway to fit with the larger keys.

**Q: Does iCanText support emoji?**  
A: You can still access the system emoji keyboard by holding the globe 🌐 icon and selecting it.
