# Privacy Policy for iCanText

**Effective Date: 21-July-2025**

Thank you for using **iCanText**, a custom iOS keyboard built for clarity and ease of use. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data — which is simple: we don’t collect any.

---

## 1. No Personal Data Collected

The iCanText keyboard does **not collect**, **store**, or **transmit** any personal data. This includes:
- Keystrokes
- Contacts
- Location
- Device data
- Any content you type

Everything stays on your device.

---

## 2. No Internet Access Required

iCanText does **not request full access**, and it does **not connect to the internet**.

- No data is sent off-device.
- No analytics, ads, or trackers.
- No server communication of any kind.

---

## 3. Local Settings Only

Any customizations (such as key colors or animations) are:
- Stored securely using Apple’s `UserDefaults`
- Shared between the keyboard and the app using **App Groups**
- Not shared outside your device

These settings affect visuals only and never include text you type.

---

## 4. Children's Privacy

iCanText does not knowingly collect data from children — or anyone, for that matter. It’s safe for all users by design.
